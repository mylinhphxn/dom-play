    <h2>Romeo and Juliet</h2>
    <div id = "play">
    <p><span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
      It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
      That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
      Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
      Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="romeo">Romeo: It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
      No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
      Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
      Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
      Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
      I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
      It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
      To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
      And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
      Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.</span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="romeo">Romeo: Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
      I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
      I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
      'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
      Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
      The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
      I have more care to stay than will to go:
      Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
      How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.</span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
      It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
      Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
      Some say the lark makes sweet division;
      This doth not so, for she divideth us:
      Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
      O, now I would they had changed voices too!
      Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
      Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
      O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
    </span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="romeo">Romeo: More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
    </span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="nurse">(Enter Nurse, to the chamber)</span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: Madam!</span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="juliet">Juliet: Nurse?</span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.
    </span></p>

    <p><span data-actor="nurse">(Exit)</span></p>
